                <p class="white-text">The reason why I chose this game as the topic of my final project is, that this game is very dear to my heart. I used to play it way back in elementary school, where I racked up over 2.5 thousand hours. Then, wanting to do other things in life, so I took a break from it. Over the course of 2018's winter break I however redownloaded the game and have found it's charm once again.</p>
                <p class="white-text">I mainly play support classes such as the medic or the engineer, because I really enjoy the teamwork in this game. There are many different ways in which you can play each class and that opens up tons of possibilities, as there are loads of synergies between the different class playstyles.</p>
                <h4 class="header main-header">The Hats</h4> <hr />
                <p class="white-text">One of the main reasons as to why this game became such a hit, was the addition of cosmetic items as a form of character customization. You could find, buy, or trade other players for different outfits, show them off on special servers dedicated just to trading, or flip them for real life cash.</p>
                <p class="white-text">Overtime, the developers added different levels of rarity, which introduced value to otherwise uninteresting items. This made some of the most valuable items be worth thousands of dollars at their primetime.</p>

                <blockquote class='white-text'>An unusual quality of the hat Brigade Helm for the Pyro class, with a Sunbeams effect. Average price is around a $100.</blockquote> 
                <h4 class="header main-header">The clases</h4> <hr />
                <p class="white-text">This game features 9 equally different and unique playable classes. All classes are unlocked from the start, and it's usually optimal for a team to have a player for every class. The classes are divided into 3 categories. Offensive, Defensive and Support classes. The first 3, Scout Soldier and Pyro are Offensive classes, Demoman Heavy and Engineer are Defensive classes and Medic Sniper and Spy are Support classes. This class segregation made up by the developers gets changed very much when you introduce unlockable weapons into the mix. Defensive classes suddenly become very mobile </p>
